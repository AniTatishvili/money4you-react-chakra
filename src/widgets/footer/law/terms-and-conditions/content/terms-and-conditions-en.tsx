      <p>
        Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified
        financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. The practice of &quot;Day Trading&quot;
        involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a
        qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to
        bear financial risks. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or
        investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through money4you.financial or our services.

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: "22px", marginBottom: "6px" }}>8. DISCLAIMER REGARDING HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS</h4>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "6px" }}>
        Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account
        will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance
        results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
        trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.
        For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can
        also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific
        trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual
        trading results.

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: "22px", marginBottom: "6px" }}>11. DERIVED DATA</h4>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "6px" }}>
        Our proprietary derivation consumes raw market data and executes a 2-factor derivation process to produce the displayed price, later consumed by the
        price engine. Derived market data is sourced and supplied from various sources and can therefore be blended.
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "6px" }}>
        The derivation process involves changing the raw price by a factor determined by the volume of trading on the underlying market, a randomized variable
        and a maximum offset amount. The derived data price is only ever displayed to our non-professional clients, the derived data price then being the
        proprietary value of an organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        At no point is raw data accessible by any client, nor can said data be reverse-engineered in any manner. All markets are passed through the same
        derivation engine.
